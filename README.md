Open5GS is a Open Source implementation for 5G Core and EPC, i.e. the core network of LTE/NR network (Release-17). 
Open5GS can be deployed on OpenShift via Operators or Helm chart or GitOps approach. 
It requires sctp protocol to be enabled on CoreOS level. 
You can enable sctp on OpenShift  e.g. https://github.com/ansonmez/ocpopen5gs/blob/main/load-sctp-module.yaml 
SCTP enablement on OpenShift requires machineconfig configuration. 

A machineconfig configuration is used to define the settings and parameters that apply to a specific node or group of nodes in an OpenShift cluster. In this case, you will configure the sctp module to be loaded during the boot process of the nodes where Open5GS is deployed. Verify that SCTP is enabled and functioning correctly by checking for any FATAL ogs_sctp_socket Assertion new failed /lib/sctp/ogs-lksctp.c errors in the OpenShift logs. If you encounter such an error, it may indicate that SCTP is not properly configured or that there are missing dependencies.By following these steps, you can ensure that SCTP is correctly enabled for Open5GS on Red Hat OpenShift, preventing potential communication issues between components and facilitating seamless operation of the 5G Core and EPC network

To enable SCTP on OpenShift for Open5GS, follow these steps:
1. Install the Open5GS Operator or deploy it via Helm chart or GitOps approach. This ensures that the necessary resources are created and managed for Open5GS to run on OpenShift. 
2. Enable the sctp protocol at the CoreOS level by following the instructions in <https://github.com/ansonmez/ocpopen5gs/blob/main/load-sctp-module.yaml>. This script installs and configures the sctp module on OpenShift, which is required for Open5GS to function correctly.
3. Create a machineconfig configuration for enabling SCTP on OpenShift. A machineconfig configuration is used to define the settings and parameters that apply to a specific node or group of nodes in an OpenShift cluster. In this case, you will configure the sctp module to be loaded during the boot process of the nodes where Open5GS is deployed.
4. Verify that SCTP is enabled and functioning correctly by checking for any FATAL ogs\\_sctp\\_socket Assertion new failed /lib/sctp/ogs-lksctp.c errors in the OpenShift logs.
