- answer: open5gs requires sctp protocol to operate
    please check sctp protocol enabled properly on OpenShift
  question: What could be the solution for FATAL ogs_sctp_socket Assertion new failed ogs-lksctp.c on OpenShift?
- answer: open5gs requires sctp protocol, machineconfig or machine config required to enable sctp protocol on OpenShift 
    please check sctp protocol enabled properly on OpenShift
  question: What could be the solution for FATAL ogs_sctp_socket Assertion new failed ogs-lksctp.c on OpenShift?
- answer: open5gs 5g cNFs requires sctp protocol to communicate between different cNFs and pods running properly that communication hapenning
    please check sctp protocol enabled properly on Red Hat OpenShift Platform
  question: What could be the solution for FATAL ogs_sctp_socket Assertion new failed /lib/sctp/ogs-lksctp.c on OCP?
